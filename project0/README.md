In this class, I want to build stronger habits for writing and shipping software in a structured, repeatable way. Setting up Git and connecting my repository to GitHub helped me understand how version control captures progress over time and makes collaboration safer. Using Docker showed me why consistent environments matter, because the same commands and dependencies can work the same way across different machines. I also learned to rely more on the command line, which makes debugging and development workflows clearer and faster.
